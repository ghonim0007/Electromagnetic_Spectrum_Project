# Remote Sensing Project: Electromagnetic Spectrum & Energy Calculation

## Introduction
This project provides a practical exercise to apply key concepts in remote sensing and the electromagnetic spectrum. It demonstrates the relationship between wavelength and energy using fundamental equations from the book **"Remote Sensing and Image Interpretation"** by **Lillesand & Kiefer**. This project helps in developing an understanding of how electromagnetic waves interact with different materials.

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: A fundamental Python library for handling data, performing mathematical operations, and managing arrays.
  - Official documentation: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
  
- **Matplotlib**: A powerful library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
  - Official documentation: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Key Equations Used

1. **Electromagnetic Wave Equation**:

   The equation relates the speed of light, frequency, and wavelength:

   

text
   c = v位

Where:

    c is the speed of light,
    v is the frequency,
    位 is the wavelength.

    Quantum Energy Equation:

    This equation is used to calculate the quantum energy based on frequency:

Q = hv

Where:

    h is Planck's constant,
    v is the frequency.

Energy and Wavelength Relationship:

This equation relates energy to wavelength:

    Q = hc / 位

    Where:
        h is Planck's constant,
        c is the speed of light,
        位 is the wavelength.

How to Use This Project

    Install the required libraries by running the following command:

    pip install numpy matplotlib

    Download the provided Jupyter Notebook and execute it to calculate energy values for different wavelengths. The results will be visualized using Matplotlib.

    Analyze the relationships between wavelength and energy in the context of the electromagnetic spectrum.
